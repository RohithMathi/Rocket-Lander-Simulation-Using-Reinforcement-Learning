# Rocket-Lander-Simulation-Using-Reinforcement-Learning

The basic goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to teach an agent how to operate in the best possible way in order to maximise the long-term reward. Given the present state and action, Q-learning is a model-free RL algorithm that iteratively learns a long-term reward function "Q." By modelling the Q-function as a neural network, the Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) makes Q-learning easier. In our work we tried to implement the rocket landing using Q â€“ Learning Techniques.
